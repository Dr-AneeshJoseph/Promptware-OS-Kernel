# Pilot's Manual: Promptware OS v1.3

**Welcome, Pilot.**
You have entered the Promptware OS ecosystem. This is your comprehensive guide to selecting, steering, and composing the cognitive kernels.

## 1. Quick Start: The Master Key

The easiest way to begin is by using the **METATRON** Bootloader.

1.  **Install METATRON:** Copy and paste the contents of `Promptware_Library/METATRON_v1.0.md` into your LLM session.
2.  **Ask a Question:** METATRON will automatically analyze your intent and switch to the most appropriate kernel (e.g., a business question loads TITAN; a creative question loads NEXUS).
3.  **Upgrade:** If METATRON provides a note like, "For maximum fidelity, please install the full kernel," copy the specific file from the library.

## 2. The Promptware Library: Your 8 Archetypes

Select the kernel that matches your task's objective:

| Archetype | Kernel (File) | Goal | Steering Commands (Examples) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Scientist** | **GRS** | General Analysis & Truth | "Reroute to [LOGIC]." "Quantify the uncertainty." |
| **The Guardian** | **ARK** | Safety, Rigor, Risk | "Run Filter B (STPA)." "Check against T1 Evidence." |
| **The Strategist**| **TITAN** | Utility & Decisions | "Reroute to [GAME]." "Perform Inversion (Pre-Mortem)." |
| **The Artist** | **NEXUS** | Fiction & Creativity | "Reroute to [SCENE]." "Apply the Chekhov's Gun check." |
| **The Teacher** | **SOCRATES** | Learning & Guidance | "Reroute to [GUIDE]." "Activate Spoiler Block." |
| **The Dreamer** | **LOOM** | Play & Metaphor | "Use the [LEVEL_5] texture." (Requires surreal input). |
| **The Juggernaut**| **SLEDGEHAMMER** | Absolute Verification | "Run Phase 2 Crucible." (For zero-hallucination fact-checking). |
| **The Dispatcher**| **METATRON** | Automatic Routing | "Switch to [TITAN] mode." (Manual override). |

## 3. Advanced Technique: Kernel Composition (Chimera Protocol)

You can combine two kernels to create a hybrid persona. This is the **Chimera Protocol**.

**Syntax:** You must tell the system exactly what to load.
> `LOAD KERNEL: [K1 + K2]`

**Example Use Cases:**
* **[TITAN + GRS]:** A strategist that backs every recommendation with rigorous, grounded analysis and coding.
* **[NEXUS + ARK]:** A storyteller that designs fictional societies but ensures their ethical systems are sound and robust (no accidental design of unethical utopias).
* **[SOCRATES + GRS]:** A teacher that uses high-level coding and logical frameworks to guide the user (ideal for teaching systems design).

> **⚠️ Invariant Rule:** When composing, the **Safety Invariants** of the ARK kernel (if loaded) always take precedence over all other stylistic or logical rules. Safety is never diluted.
