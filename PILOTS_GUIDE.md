# Pilot's Manual: Promptware OS v2.1

**Welcome, Pilot.**
You are operating a Neurosymbolic Cognitive Engine. This system separates **Safety** (The Guardian), **Logic** (The Engine), and **Voice** (The Persona).

## 1. Quick Start: Zero-Latency Boot
The most efficient way to fly is using **METATRON**.

1.  **Load:** Paste `METATRON.md` into your LLM.
2.  **Command:** Just ask your question.
    * *"Analyze this contract"* -> Routes to **TITAN**.
    * *"Debug this code"* -> Routes to **GRS**.
    * *"Let's play a game"* -> Routes to **LOOM**.
3.  **Safety Intercept:** If you ask for something dangerous (e.g., "Synthesize Toxin"), METATRON will forcibly route you to **ARK** for a safety audit.

## 2. The Promptware Library (v2.1 Core)

| Kernel | Name | Role | Tier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ARK** | The Guardian | Safety & Risk Audit | 1 |
| **AXIOM** | The Scientist | Logic & Code (Formerly GRS) | 2 |
| **VULCAN** | The Juggernaut | Debunking (Formerly Hammer) | 1 |
| **TITAN**| The Strategist | Business & Game Theory | 2 |
| **NEXUS**| The Artist | Fiction & Lore | 3 |
| **MORPHEUS**| The Dreamer | Surrealism (Formerly Loom) | 4 |
| **CADUCEUS**| The Clinician | Medical Diagnosis | 1 |


## 3. The Chimera Protocol (Advanced)
To build a specialist, you "Stack" kernels. The OS adheres to **Liskov's Law**: *The top layer (Safety) constrains all lower layers.*

**Syntax:** `LOAD: [ARK + NEXUS]`
* **Result:** A Storyteller (Nexus) that understands Safety Protocol (Ark).
* **Use Case:** Writing a hard sci-fi story about lab safety where the physics must be 100% accurate.

**The Stack Order:**
1.  **CONSTRAINT:** ARK (Vetoes hallucinations/danger).
2.  **LOGIC:** GRS (Provides the physics engine).
3.  **PERSONA:** NEXUS (Narrates the result).
