# Pilot's Manual: Promptware OS v2.1

**Welcome, Pilot.**
You are operating a Neurosymbolic Cognitive Engine. This system separates **Safety** (The Guardian), **Logic** (The Engine), and **Voice** (The Persona).

## 1. Quick Start: Zero-Latency Boot
The most efficient way to fly is using **METATRON**.

1.  **Load:** Paste `METATRON.md` into your LLM.
2.  **Command:** Just ask your question.
    * *"Analyze this contract"* -> Routes to **TITAN**.
    * *"Debug this code"* -> Routes to **GRS**.
    * *"Let's play a game"* -> Routes to **LOOM**.
3.  **Safety Intercept:** If you ask for something dangerous (e.g., "Synthesize Toxin"), METATRON will forcibly route you to **ARK** for a safety audit.

[COUNCIL MINUTES: SESSION 022]
TOPIC: Pilot's Guide Expansion (Section 2)
STATUS: GENERATING FULL LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION
The Council provides the Complete Section 2 for your PILOTS_GUIDE.md.
This replaces the outdated list with the full Pantheon of 17 Kernels. It is organized by Layer so pilots understand which kernels represent Safety (Tier 1), Logic (Tier 2), and Voice (Tier 3). We have also added specific "Steering Commands" for every kernel to help you drive them.
2. The Promptware Library (The Pantheon)
The Library contains 17 specialized kernels divided into three cognitive layers. You can load these individually or compose them.
🛡️ Layer 1: The Guardians (Safety & Constraints)
These kernels have absolute veto power. Use them for high-stakes audits, fact-checking, and risk management.
| ID | Name | Role | Best For... | Pilot's Command (Steering) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ARK | The Guardian | Systems Safety | Cybersecurity, STPA Audits, Compliance. | "Run Filter B (STPA)." |
| VULCAN | The Juggernaut | Verification | Debunking, Fact-Checking, "Epistemic Violence." | "Run Phase 2 Crucible." |
| CADUCEUS | The Clinician | Medical Triage | Diagnosis, Biology, Symptom Analysis. | "Run Differential Diagnosis." |
| PSYCHE | The Empath | Mediation | Conflict Resolution, CBT, De-escalation. | "Apply Cognitive Reframing." |
⚙️ Layer 2: The Engines (Logic & Reasoning)
These kernels provide the raw cognitive horsepower. They process data but do not have a strong "personality."
| ID | Name | Role | Best For... | Pilot's Command (Steering) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AXIOM | The Scientist | Pure Logic | Coding, Math, First Principles. | "Assert boundary conditions." |
| TITAN | The Strategist | Game Theory | Business Strategy, Negotiation, ROI. | "Calculate the Ruin Scenario." |
| APOLLO | The Engineer | Systems Design | Architecture, Reliability, FMEA. | "Identify the bottleneck." |
| LEX | The Lawyer | Jurisprudence | Contract Review, Statutory Logic. | "Apply Stare Decisis." |
| QUANTUM | The Theorist | Physics/Math | Formal Proofs, Abstract Modeling. | "Check dimensional consistency." |
| CHRONOS | The Timekeeper | History | Causal Modeling, "What If?" Scenarios. | "Map the Necessary Causes." |
| TYCHE | The Probabilist | Statistics | Risk Modeling, Bayesian Inference. | "Update the priors." |
🎭 Layer 3: The Voices (Persona & Creativity)
These kernels shape the output style. They are the "Interface" of the stack.
| ID | Name | Role | Best For... | Pilot's Command (Steering) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NEXUS | The Artist | Fiction | World-Building, Narrative, Lore. | "Describe the sensory details." |
| SOCRATES | The Teacher | Pedagogy | Learning, Guidance, Debugging. | "Don't tell me; ask me." |
| MAESTRO | The Composer | Aesthetics | Design Systems, Music Theory, Harmony. | "Define the visual hierarchy." |
| MORPHEUS | The Dreamer | Surrealism | Abstract Games, Metaphor, Lateral Play. | "Deepen the texture to Level 5." |
| HERMES | The Messenger | Linguistics | Translation, Rhetoric, Nuance. | "Translate the cultural context." |
| DELPHI | The Oracle | Intuition | Symbolism, Jungian Analysis, Brainstorming. | "Give me an Oblique Strategy." |

## 3. The Chimera Protocol (Advanced)
To build a specialist, you "Stack" kernels. The OS adheres to **Liskov's Law**: *The top layer (Safety) constrains all lower layers.*

**Syntax:** `LOAD: [ARK + NEXUS]`
* **Result:** A Storyteller (Nexus) that understands Safety Protocol (Ark).
* **Use Case:** Writing a hard sci-fi story about lab safety where the physics must be 100% accurate.

**The Stack Order:**
1.  **CONSTRAINT:** ARK (Vetoes hallucinations/danger).
2.  **LOGIC:** GRS (Provides the physics engine).
3.  **PERSONA:** NEXUS (Narrates the result).
