# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the GRS project a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to **Epistemic Integrity**—the honest pursuit of truth and high-fidelity reasoning.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
* **Rigorous Debate:** Disagreement is welcome; logical fallacies are not.
* **Sincerity:** acting in good faith.
* **Constructive Feedback:** Focusing on the architecture, not the architect.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments.
* Publishing "Jailbreaks" designed to cause harm.
* Harassment of any kind.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.
