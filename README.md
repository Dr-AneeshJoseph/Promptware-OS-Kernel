🚀 Promptware OS Kernel Suite
> "Truth > Speed."
> 
This repository contains the reference implementation of Promptware OS v1.3, a standard for installing cognitive operating systems into Large Language Models (LLMs).
Promptware OS transforms an LLM into a specialized, stateful agent governed by four core philosophical laws (e.g., The Law of Antifragility).
🧠 The Promptware Library: The 8 Archetypes
The library contains 8 distinct neurosymbolic kernels, covering the full spectrum of human cognitive needs: Logic, Safety, Strategy, Creativity, Pedagogy, and Verification.
| Archetype | Kernel File | Full Name | Focus | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The Scientist | GRS_v12.md | Grounded Reasoning System | Truth, Clarity, Antifragility | Daily usage, coding, complex analysis. |
| The Guardian | ARK_v12.md | Antifragile Resilience Kernel | Scientific Rigor, Safety | Risk assessment, systems engineering, defense. |
| The Strategist | TITAN_v1.md | Strategic Executive Kernel | Utility, ROI, Game Theory | Business strategy, negotiation, decision making. |
| The Artist | NEXUS_v1.md | Narrative Kernel | Coherence, Immersion, Lore | Fiction, world-building, screenwriting. |
| The Teacher | SOCRATES_v1.md | Pedagogical Kernel | Maieutics, Scaffolding | Tutoring, learning new skills, debugging. |
| The Juggernaut | SLEDGEHAMMER_v1.md | Extreme Verification Kernel | Rigor, Overkill, Zero-Hallucination | High-stakes verification, debunking, stress-testing. |
| The Dreamer | LOOM_v1.md | Noumenal Loom Kernel | Creativity, Metaphor, Game | A Survival Game. Keep the dream alive or die trying. |
| The Dispatcher | METATRON_v1.md | Universal Bootloader | Automatic Routing, Lite Mode | Easy Start. Routes intent to the correct kernel. |
🛠️ Installation & Deployment
Installation involves copying and pasting the kernel file into a new LLM session. Choose your path:
Option A: The Master Key (Recommended)
Use METATRON_v1.0.md.
 * What it is: A Bootloader that contains "Lite" versions of all kernels.
 * How it works: It automatically switches between Archetypes based on your question, eliminating guesswork.
 * Best for: General usage, quick tasks, and exploring the ecosystem.
Option B: The Specialist (High Fidelity)
Use a specific kernel file (e.g., TITAN or SLEDGEHAMMER).
 * What it is: A dedicated, full-power architecture with all its specific deep methods loaded.
 * Best for: Deep work (e.g., writing a novel, engineering a safety system, rigorous verification).
✨ Advanced: Kernel Composition (Chimera Protocol)
Promptware OS v1.3 allows you to combine two kernels into a single composite agent.
Syntax: You load the base kernel, then issue the composition command:
> LOAD KERNEL: [K1 + K2]
> 
Example: LOAD KERNEL: [NEXUS + ARK] creates a Storyteller that rigorously adheres to safety and ethical invariants.
