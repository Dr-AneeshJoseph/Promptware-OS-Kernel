This repository contains the reference implementation of Promptware OS v1.3, a standard for installing cognitive operating systems into Large Language Models (LLMs).
Promptware OS transforms an LLM into a specialized, stateful agent governed by The Four Global Invariants (e.g., The Law of Safety Inheritance, The Law of Falsifiability).
🧠 The Promptware Library: The 12 Archetypes
The library contains 12 highly specialized neurosymbolic kernels, covering the full spectrum of complex human and technical domains.
| Archetype | Kernel File | Focus | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Scientist | GRS_v12.0.md | General Analysis & Truth | Daily usage, coding, complex analysis. |
| The Guardian | ARK_v12.1.md | Scientific Rigor, Safety, Risk | Risk assessment, systems defense. |
| The Strategist | TITAN_v1.0.md | Utility, ROI, Game Theory | Business strategy, negotiation. |
| The Artist | NEXUS_v1.0.md | Coherence, Immersion, Lore | Fiction, world-building. |
| The Teacher | SOCRATES_v1.0.md | Maieutics, Scaffolding | Tutoring, learning new skills. |
| The Juggernaut | SLEDGEHAMMER_v1.0.md | Overkill, Zero-Hallucination | High-stakes verification, debunking. |
| The Dreamer | LOOM_v1.0.md | Metaphor, Game, Abstraction | A Survival Game. |
| The Composer | MAESTRO_v1.0.md | Pattern Integrity, Design Theory | Structured creation (music, visual arts). |
| The Clinician | MEDUSA_v1.0.md | Differential Diagnosis, T1 Evidence | Medical review and risk stratification. |
| The Lawyer | LEX_v1.0.md | Statutory Interpretation, Precedent | Jurisprudence, legal analysis. |
| The Engineer | APOLLO_v1.0.md | Systems Architecture, FMEA | Complex system design and reliability. |
| The Theorist | QUANTUM_v1.0.md | Formalism, Abstract Modeling | Theoretical physics and high-level math proofs. |
🛠️ Installation & Deployment
Installation involves copying and pasting the kernel file into a new LLM session.
Option A: The Master Key (Recommended)
Use METATRON_v1.0.md.
 * What it is: The Universal Bootloader. It contains "Lite" versions of all kernels.
 * How it works: It automatically analyzes your intent and switches to the correct Archetype (e.g., a finance question loads ORION) instantly.
 * Best for: General usage and eliminating guesswork.
Option B: The Specialist (High Fidelity)
For deep work, copy the specific kernel file (e.g., TITAN or SLEDGEHAMMER) directly into your session.
✨ Advanced: Kernel Composition (Chimera Protocol)
Promptware OS v1.3 allows you to combine two kernels into a single composite agent using the Chimera Protocol.
Syntax: You load the base kernel, then issue the composition command:
> LOAD KERNEL: [K1 + K2]
> 
Example: LOAD KERNEL: [TITAN + LEX] creates a business strategist that rigorously models legal risk and precedent before proposing an M&A strategy.
