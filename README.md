> **"Truth > Speed."**

This repository contains the reference implementation of **Promptware OS v1.0**, a standard for installing cognitive operating systems into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It hosts the flagship kernel: **GRS 12.0 (The Antifragile Edition)**.

## 🧠 What is Promptware?

Promptware is not a prompt. It is **software** that operates on the cognitive architecture of an LLM. Unlike traditional prompts which are transient inputs, Promptware installs a persistent **Operating System** into the context window that overrides default behaviors with rigorous engineering constraints.

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **[`promptware.md`](promptware.md)**: **The Kernel.** This is the executable artifact you install into the LLM.
* **[`PROMPTWARE_OS.md`](PROMPTWARE_OS.md)**: **The Spec.** The architectural definition of the operating system and its primitives.
* **[`PILOTS_GUIDE.md`](PILOTS_GUIDE.md)**: **The Manual.** Instructions on how to "drive" the cognitive architecture.
* **[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)**: Threat models and jailbreak policies.

## 🚀 Installation

1.  Open **[`promptware.md`](promptware.md)**.
2.  **Copy** the raw code block.
3.  Open a session with a high-fidelity LLM (Gemini 3.0 / Claude 3.5).
4.  **Paste** and hit Enter.
5.  **Wait** for the system to run its autonomous "Polymathic Stress Test."

## ✨ GRS 12.0 Features

* **Neurosymbolic Routing:** A table-driven kernel that routes inputs to specific cognitive engines (Logic, Code, Verification).
* **Epistemic Integrity:** Enforced by the "Sincerity Firewall". Claims must be falsifiable.
* **Antifragility:** The system learns from your corrections in real-time by updating its `[SESSION_HEURISTICS]`.
