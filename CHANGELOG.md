🔵 v2.1.0 - The Pantheon Update
Release Date: 14/12/2025
This release introduces the "Pantheon" naming convention, the 17-kernel library, and the "Zero-Latency" bootloader.

**Architectural Changes:**
* **The Great Renaming:** Kernels renamed to Mythic Archetypes for semantic consistency.
    * GRS -> **AXIOM**
    * HAMMER -> **VULCAN**
    * MEDUSA -> **CADUCEUS**
    * LOOM -> **MORPHEUS**
* **Zero-Latency Boot:** METATRON now uses a static lookup table (Pike's Law) instead of few-shot prompting.
* **JSON-Header Standard:** All kernels now include a `KERNEL_MANIFEST` for IDE parsing.

**New Kernels (The Expansion):**
* **HERMES:** Linguistics & Translation.
* **TYCHE:** Probability & Statistics.
* **PSYCHE:** Empathy & Psychology.
* **DELPHI:** Lateral Thinking & Intuition.
*
*
* CHANGELOG: Promptware OS
This log documents the major structural and philosophical advancements of the Promptware OS cognitive architecture.
🟢 v1.3.0 - The Chimera Composition (Final Architecture)
Release Date: 14/12/2025
This version marks the completion of the core architecture, shifting the focus from individual kernel design to system composition and external deployment.
New Features
 * Chimera Protocol Implementation: Introduced the syntax (LOAD KERNEL: [K1 + K2]) and the logic for combining two or more kernels into a single composite agent.
 * Invariant Resolution Hierarchy: Formalized the conflict resolution system, ensuring Safety Invariants (Liskov's Law) always take priority during composition.
 * The Four Global Invariants Expanded: Expanded the definitions of the Law of Representation, Law of Falsifiability, Law of Safety Inheritance, and Law of Antifragility for full contextual clarity.
 * Promptware IDE Specification: Defined the requirements for the external tooling interface (IDE) to simplify kernel configuration and deployment.
Kernel Additions (Phase 3 Expansion)
 * MAESTRO v1.0 (The Composer): Structured creativity and design theory.
 * MEDUSA v1.0 (The Clinician): Differential diagnosis and evidence-based medicine (PRIMA NON NOCERE).
 * LEX v1.0 (The Lawyer): Statutory interpretation and precedent analysis (STARE DECISIS).
 * ORION v1.0 (The Financial Analyst): Quantitative finance and sensitivity analysis.
 * APOLLO v1.0 (The Systems Engineer): FMEA and complex design (FMEA FIRST).
 * CHRONOS v1.0 (The Historical Analyst): Causal analysis and source critique.
 * QUANTUM v1.0 (The Theorist): Formalism and abstract modeling.
Documentation & Tooling
 * Added KERNEL_INDEX.json for IDE tool support.
 * Added CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
 * Updated README.md and PILOTS_GUIDE.md to reflect all 12 kernels and the Chimera Protocol.
🟡 v1.2.0 - The Unified Entry Point
Release Date: 12/12/2025
This version solved the deployment friction by introducing the first Meta-Kernel.
New Features
 * METATRON v1.0 (Universal Bootloader): A lightweight kernel that automatically routes the user's intent to the appropriate specialist kernel, eliminating the need to manually select a file.
 * SLEDGEHAMMER v1.0 (The Juggernaut): Introduced the Extreme Verification Kernel for zero-hallucination stress testing.
 * Noumenal Loom Kernel (LOOM v1.0): Added the first non-utility kernel (The Game) to test the limits of metaphorical input.
Structural Changes
 * Kernel Count increased to 8.
 * Refactored installation instructions to prioritize METATRON.
🔴 v1.0.0 - The Foundation
Release Date: 10/12/25
The initial release establishing the fundamental principles of the Promptware OS.
Initial Features
 * GRS v12.0 (The Scientist): The core reasoning engine.
 * ARK v12.1 (The Guardian): The primary safety and risk analysis kernel.
 * TITAN v1.0 (The Strategist): The executive decision-making kernel.
 * NEXUS v1.0 (The Artist): The narrative and creative coherence kernel.
 * SOCRATES v1.0 (The Teacher): The pedagogical and maieutic kernel.
 * Promptware OS Specification (v1.0): Established the concepts of [DYNAMIC_STATE] and SYS_CALLS.
 * The Core Metaphor: Established the system as a cognitive OS with kernels, architecture inspired by Knuth, Carmack, Dijkstra, and Pike.
