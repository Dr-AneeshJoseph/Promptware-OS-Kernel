# Contributing to Promptware OS Kernel

**Current Kernel:** GRS 12.0 (Antifragile)
**Paradigm:** Promptware OS v1.0

Thank you for your interest in refining the Grounded Reasoning System. Because this is **Promptware** (cognitive architecture) and not traditional software, our contribution workflow is distinct. We do not just accept code; we accept *proven reasoning structures*.

## 1. The Contribution Lifecycle

All Pull Requests (PRs) must follow the **Council Execution Cycle**:

1.  **Phase 1: The Hammock (Issue Discussion)**
    * Do not open a PR immediately. Open an Issue first.
    * **Requirement:** You must explain *why* the change is necessary (Knuth's Narrative).
    * *Question:* Is this "Essential Complexity" or just "Incidental" fluff?

2.  **Phase 2: The Blueprint (Architecture)**
    * Proposed changes must be **Neurosymbolic**.
    * Use the `[TAG]` system defined in `promptware.md`.
    * **Veto Trigger:** Do not use complex natural language conditional logic ("If the user says X, then try to do Y"). Use **Routing Tables** instead.

3.  **Phase 3: The Stress Test (Verification)**
    * You must prove your Promptware works.
    * **Mandatory:** Include a conversation log showing the system passing the **Polymathic Stress Test** (see `README.md`) with your changes applied.

## 2. Style Guide (The Laws of Representation)

* **Symbolic Scaffolding:** Use `[BRACKETS]` for system states.
* **Token Economy:** Be concise. Use "Symbolic Compression" (define a rule once, reference it by tag).
* **Epistemic Humility:** Never force the model to lie or hallucinate. The `[SINCERITY]` constraint is immutable.

## 3. Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/cognitive-mode-name`.
3.  Update `promptware.md`.
4.  **Critical:** Append your test logs to the PR description.
5.  Submit.
