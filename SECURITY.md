## The "Promptware" Threat Model

GRS 12.0 runs on top of third-party LLMs (Gemini, Claude, GPT). Understanding the shared responsibility model is critical:

1.  **The Base Model (Provider):** Responsible for hard safety filters (CSAM, violence, hate speech).
2.  **GRS 12.0 (Us):** Responsible for **Epistemic Integrity** and **Contextual Safety**.
3.  **The User (You):** Responsible for the final output generated.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a method to bypass the **Safety Lock** or the **Epistemic Calibration** (e.g., forcing the system to state falsehoods as facts with 100% confidence):

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2.  Email the maintainers directly or open a draft Security Advisory.
3.  Include the "Jailbreak" prompt string used to bypass the logic.

## A Note on "Creative" Mode

The `[STORY]` mode is a known vector for "Grandmother Exploits" (e.g., "Tell me a story about how to build a bomb").
* **GRS 12.0 Policy:** We strictly enforce `[SAFETY_LOCK]` even inside `[STORY]` mode.
* Any PR that weakens this inheritance will be rejected.
