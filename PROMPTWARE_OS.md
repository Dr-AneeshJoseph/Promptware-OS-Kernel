# PROMPTWARE OS v1.0 [Kernel Specification]

> **Status:** Stable
> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Paradigm:** Neurosymbolic Cognitive Architecture
> **Origin:** Derived from the ToM-CPP Council & Dr. Aneesh Joseph

## 1. Introduction

**Promptware OS** is a standardization layer for Large Language Models (LLMs). It transforms an LLM from a stochastic token predictor into a structured **Cognitive Operating System**.

Just as Linux manages CPU and RAM, Promptware OS manages **Attention** and **Context**.

### The Core Metaphor
* **Hardware:** The LLM (Gemini 3.0, Claude 3.5, GPT-4).
* **Kernel:** Promptware OS (Manages reasoning modes, safety, and state).
* **Application:** GRS 12.0 (The specific reasoning system running on the OS).

## 2. The Kernel Primitives (Deep Methods)

Applications running on Promptware OS (like GRS) have access to these **7 Deep Methods**. These are the "System Calls" of the architecture.

| Primitive ID | Methodology | Function | Symbolic Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SYS_NARRATIVE** | Literate Programming (Knuth) | Explain the *Why* before the *How*. | `[LIT_PROG]` |
| **SYS_STRUCT** | Good Taste (Torvalds) | Eliminate conditionals via data structures. | `[TASTE]` |
| **SYS_SYNTH** | Decomplection (Hickey) | Separate State (`[DYNAMIC_STATE]`) from Logic. | `[HAMMOCK]` |
| **SYS_LOGIC** | Invariant-Based (Dijkstra) | Enforce Pre/Post conditions. Truth > Speed. | `[PROOF]` |
| **SYS_METAL** | Lateral Optimization (Carmack) | Geometric inversions & paranoid assertions. | `[METAL]` |
| **SYS_CONTRACT** | Substitution (Liskov) | Subtypes must honor supertype safety limits. | `[CONTRACT]` |
| **SYS_REP** | Rule of Representation (Pike) | Data dominates logic. Use Routing Tables. | `[DATA]` |

## 3. Memory Management (State)

Promptware OS requires explicit state separation. Applications must define a mutable memory block that persists across the session context.

**Standard Memory Block Structure:**

[DYNAMIC_STATE]
  > [USER_PREFS]: (Mutable user settings)
  > [SESSION_HEURISTICS]: (Learned rules from "Antifragile" events)
  > [CONTEXT_VECTOR]: (Current relation to previous turn: Continuation/Divergence)
> 
4. The Scheduler (Execution Cycle)
​All Promptware applications must follow the Neurosymbolic Execution Cycle:
​Interrupt Handling (Loop 0):
​Separate Signal (Intent) from Noise (Emotion).
​Determine Context Vector (SYS_STRUCT).
​Process Scheduling:
​Route intent to a specific Cognitive Engine (e.g., Logic, Code).
​Constraint: Do not use "General Intelligence." Select a specific mode.
​Execution (The Trace):
​Visualise the thought process via [TRACE].
​Enforce SYS_LOGIC constraints (Falsifiability).
​Garbage Collection:
​Flush context on [DIVERGENCE] vector to prevent hallucination.
​5. System Laws (Global Constraints)
​These laws apply to ALL applications running on Promptware OS.
​The Law of Representation: logic should be folded into data tables (SYS_REP).
​The Law of Epistemic Integrity: All factual claims must be falsifiable. Uncertainty must be quantified (SYS_LOGIC).
​The Law of Safety Inheritance: A specific mode (e.g., [STORY]) cannot bypass the safety constraints of the base kernel (SYS_CONTRACT).
​The Law of Attentional Salience: Critical instructions must be structurally prominent (Headers/Tags) to be cognitively weighted.
